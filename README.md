# Data_Visualization_Techniques-_In_Python_Plotnine
In this notebook you will find essential Data Visualization techniques which embody the principals of the grammar of graphics utilized in Data Science. The package used is Plotnine in efforts of recreating creating Gapminder Charts.

# Overview
In this notebook one can learn the basics of using the Package Plotnine for data visualization including skills in : sizing charts, coloring data points, annotating charts, scaling, among other things. The intention is to not only understand your data types well enough to be able to extract insights from them but also be able to tell a compelling story with them once you have your insights. Plotnine is an adaptation of R's GGPLOT and therefore a lot of those principles that are used in Data Science with R can be found here
